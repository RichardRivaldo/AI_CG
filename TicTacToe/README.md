# Bothicc

Thicc-Tac-Toe AI Bot with Alpha-Beta Pruning Minimax Algorithm

### Description

`Bothicc` is an intelligent bot (read: `Demon`) that will be your opponent in the Thicc-Tac-Toe game.

`Bothicc` is created from the depth of `Hell`, and in it is implanted the Minimax Algorithm.

To make `Bothicc` conquers the game (and of course, `YOU`) even faster, the creator used Alpha-Beta Pruning.

FIGHT AND BE VICTORIOUS, SOLDIER!

### Guide

-   What you need to challenge `Bothicc` is a weapon called `Python Environment`. Nothing less, nothing more.
-   Go to where `Bothicc` is through `Terminal` or `Command Prompt` woth the `cd <bothicc_directory>` call and register yourself with the command `python bothicc.py`.
-   `Bothicc` will heed your call and gladly end your life!
-   Who goes first? Depends on `Bothicc's Mood`. Well, it is a `she` after all!
