# Q-ty

A Q-Learning Implementation for a simple game bot.

### Description

`Q-ty` is an acute agent trained to be one of the best problem solver in the world. Well, it is a really hard problem, can't find anyone who can solve it!

In a horizontal, one-dimensional `environment`, `Q-ty` starts at the fourth tile. It can move right and left freely. But(?)

WATCH OUT. The first tile is a `HOLE`, and the last tile is a tree of `BANANAS`. If `Q-ty` falls through the `HOLE`, `Q-ty` will hurt itself and thus lost one point. By gaining `BANANAS`, `Q-ty` can charge its energy and get one point!

When `Q-ty` reaches +5, `Q-ty` will win the game! Not so sure what will happen to it when it reaches -5, though.

No worries, the sophisticated algorithm `Q-Learning` will really help and support `Q-ty`'s learning and training, and so will you!

### Guide

-   What you need to train and play `Q-ty` is a bone called `Python Environment`. Nothing less, nothing more.
-   Go to where `Q-ty` is through `Terminal` or `Command Prompt` with the `cd <q-ty_directory>` call and register yourself with the command `python q_learning.py`.
-   `Q-ty` will gladly heed and do your training!
-   After the training session is done, you can play with `Q-ty` and test its training! Or not...
