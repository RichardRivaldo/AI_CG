# 3D-Shape

Simple 3D Shape Visualization and Rotation with WebGL and GLMatrix

### Description

`Boxie` is just a relaxed, easy-going box. He is cheerful and had always been colorful since the day he was born, and... a slowpoke...

On the other hand, `Pyra` is a hyperactive girl who likes to wear exotic black dress whenever she goes. Well, she is a fast dancer!

Both of them grow in `WebGL` environment. Yup, they run away from OpenGL, just because!

Too bad, they are not that `interactive` and they don't let you make contact with them.

But, who knows?

### Guide

-   To take a peek at how `Boxie` and `Pyra` are doing, you will need some kind of local server like `NodeJS`. If you have Python installed, big chances there is also `http.server` installed. This can be used to start a local server too.
-   Go to where `Boxie's` and `Pyra's` showdown is through `Terminal` or `Command Prompt` with the `cd <3D-Shape_directory>`. Don't get too close and deep with them!.
-   Give your ticket through using the command `python -m http.server`.
-   Go to your nearest browser and type `localhost:8000/src` or whatever port your computer is on to see how spectacular our models are!
